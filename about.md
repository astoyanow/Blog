# A Little Bit of Everything

I am currently a senior attending Hendrix College, where I am also a pitcher for the Hendrix Warriors Baseball Team. I am originally from Kapolei, Hawaii where I attended Kapolei High School and also played baseball there. I love playing video games, watching movies/YouTube/anime, and working out.
