# About Me

I am currently a senior computer science major attending Hendrix College, where I am also a pitcher for the Hendrix Warriors Baseball Team. I am originally from Kapolei, Hawaii where I attended Kapolei High School and also played baseball there. I love playing video games, watching movies/YouTube/anime, and working out. I love all animals equally (except for mosquitoes, flies, and cockroaches. Sorry but not really) and would like to own at least one cat and one dog when I am older.

I grew up obsessed with sharks and dinosaurs and originally wanted to
become a marine biologist. At the start of high school, I wanted to work in forensics
and the criminal justice department. However, I got more into technology and loved working with my hands and solving puzzles. As a junior in high school, I got into the
Health Academy section of my high school and enjoyed learning about the human
body, which somewhat led me to the desire of becoming a nurse or some other
career in the health industry. Still, I was pretty set on working in cybersecurity
or becoming a programmer.

When I got to college, I struggled extremely hard in Data Structures (I skipped
Foundations of Computer Science because I took AP Computer Science in high school).
I was the last to finish in every lab and had no idea what was going on in lectures.
I also had a professor who was new and whose first language was not English.
It got to a point where I was about to switch my major to become a Health Science
major and become a nurse. I had a talk with my advisor who understood my struggle
and did not try to convince me to stay or switch, but still was able to put the
thought in my head to just stick with it and see it through. I passed the class
with an A and kept going and kept working hard and now I am a senior computer science
major just two semester away from graduation.
