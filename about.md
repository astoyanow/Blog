My name is Andrei Stoyanow and I am a college student that attends Hendrix College in Conway, Arkansas. I play baseball for the Hendrix College Warriors and currently undecided in terms of my major. I am from Kapolei, Oahu, Hawaii so I am a long ways from home than most people. I am working towards either a degree in Computer Science or Health Science, potentially minoring in Computer Science.
