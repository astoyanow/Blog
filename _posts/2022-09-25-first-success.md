It has been a long 2-3 weeks since starting things with Arkansas Asset Builders but I finally completed the first objective of mine for the project this past week. I managed to create a JAR file for the project that is able to run the project outside of the project environment and even from the file explorer. I did not need to create an executable as the way that it is set up now works and fulfills the purpose of having something that can launch the project from anywhere in the user's system. The only thing that may be of concern is the user having Java installed into their computer in order to run the JAR file, which would be another issue that we would need to address. Either way, we have something that functions properly and fixes an issue that we have (for now).

We were supposed to have put the project together to create something barebones but we have fallen behind schedule and are working to get back on track. Olivia managed to merge her pull request so now we have a landing page and a page for uploading files to be processed. Lucy has been backed up with other responsibilities and Matthew is waiting for Lucy's page in order to progress on his issues, which are just processes that would be carried out when filtering requests from the database. Though we are not where we want to be, we are making progress and getting to a point where we can make more meaningful contributions and learning about what our project will need. Soon we will be on top of things and understand what will be needed and how we can implement those changes. I will be doing my best to stay on top of the organization of things as well as helping my group mates in any way that I can.
