Writing code and getting things to work can either be the most fun and rewarding activity or the most frustrating and defeating activity, and this past week has been a lot more of the latter. I was stuck on a functional programming question for a week and spent at least 10 hours on it and maybe made a few adjustments after trying to figure out how to get past the problem for hours. In the end, I could not figure it out and turned in the assignment half finished. Trying to fix the navbar situation from last week was just dirt on the wound. I made very little progress on the navbar and sidebar situation. I was able to get the sidebar to show up and disappear when the screen gets to a certain size, but I was not able to fix the sidebar overlapping the navbar or get the hamburger icon to show the sidebar elements when the hamburger is clicked. 

Not being able to fix what seems like a small and minor fix is extremely frustrating. Not only does it feel like you are not making any sort of progress whatsoever, it makes you feel incompetent because of how difficult something so small of a fix can be. I feel like I have been getting used to the Bootstrap classes and HTML but then I try something and absolutely nothing has changed.
