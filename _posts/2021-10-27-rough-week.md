This week was a struggle for me. I was tasked with adjusting the interaction
that users have with quotes, now having to implement favoriting and removing
quotes from the user's list of quotes. Trying to understand the way that
Firestore Firebase works inside of the application was quite difficult, with
all of the different ways that the application state worked within the app.
The local database was a little easier to understand but I am still quite
unsure about how to actually interact with the database. Most of the week was
to learn about the database interaction.

On a good note, I updated the quotes so that they have a button for removing the
quote from the list without having the need to share the quote with another user
(in case the holder of the quote thinks the others should not have to read the
lame quote either).

Hopefully I will be able to get a better understanding of the database this
week. I will be working extra hard to get this done especially since my
teammate Andrew and his tasks will eventually coincide with mine (he is working
on making sure quotes are not re-sent to users who have already received the
quote before). I am quite anxious and nervous because I do not enjoy letting my
team down but I just need to give it the best I got.
