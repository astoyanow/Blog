  This week I was tasked in creating a static webpage for the Good Vibes mobile
app where people could go and get a feel for the app and learn a little about it
before acquiring the app. I searched through some Jekyll templates for landing pages
and found one that was simple enough for a static webpage while also being easy
to navigate and appealing to the eye. It was not too difficult of a task now that
I was getting back into website design from Disco Tray Studios. As the app progresses
and gets closer to deployment, more changes are going to be made to the webpage which
is very exciting.

  I was also tasked with acquiring more quotes for the Good Vibes app. The goal for
now is 300 quotes. Right now we are at 167, so a little over halfway there. I had to
make sure the quotes were from a collection of sources so that the quotes were not
constrained to only being from a certain group of people. I also had to make sure
the quotes were inclusive of all people and did not possibly leave anyone out.

  I am still tasked with adding quotes to the app. However, after finishing the
webpage (for now), I am now working on database security for the database that
the app is currently utilizing. Good Vibes uses Firebase, a remote database set up
by Google. Users are able to set rules for reading, writing, and other actions
so that certain actions can only be performed as long as the rules are followed.
This helps to keep the database secure so that malicious users do not exploit
the database in a way where they can possibly retrieve information, ruin the app,
or perform unwanted action within the app. Firebase uses NoSQL, a non-deterministic
database that uses documents and collections with key-value pairs, almost like
JavaScript. I am currently reading the docs and security walkthroughs as I
learn how to make the database secure.

  I also got a new computer this past weekend so now I do not have to wait a
billion years to open Android Studio :D .
