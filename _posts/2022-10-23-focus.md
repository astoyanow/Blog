This week I have had to focus on Arkansas Asset Builders and my task on there. I am still working on the parser that parses CSV files. I am basically finished and now need to test and debug. At first I was struggling with just getting the parser to read the file canonically so that the absolute path is not needed for when files are loaded to the program manually. I am running into problems with just finding the index of where a String is inside of a list. For some reason, the method is not recognizing the String in the list even though everything is spelled correctly; a -1 is returned meaning that the String does not exist in the list. Still trying to figure that out.
