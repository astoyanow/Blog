As thre semester draws closer and closer to an end, Disco Tray works harder and harder to start getting things to come together to work and create a product for the user. Arkansas Asset Builders' application has gone through a long process of being created in class for a project, to being brought back to the drawing board, to then being recreated and worked on. We are behind on getting something to work as one of the group members has had to drop out and the others have a high workload which makes it hard for them to get any work done.

However, we finally have something that has functionality. We have a main screen to upload documents to the database that implements the parser that parses the CSV file. The parser works for all of the sample files given to use from Professor Yorgey and the insertion functions all work as well for all tables. The filter somewhat works for the results, the only problem is joining the tables around the tax year when filtering with other tables that contain the tax year, since it is a foreign key. However, all of the data looks good and proper.

The only thing we need now is to adjust filtering functionality and export the data for Professor Yorgey. After that is creating a JAR to make sure that the product can be run locally on another machine. As for now, it is a small and delayed victory but a victory nonetheless.
