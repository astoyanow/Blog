We are finally back to school after a month of winter break. This semester I am going to be busier with baseball season coming around as well as having two higher level computer science classes (Artificial Intelligence and Functional Programming). Since I am a senior, I will also have to start applying for internships and jobs, so the semester will be a challenge but it will be a time for growth. I am very excited not only to be back with Disco Tray Studios, but to be taking challenging courses to learn more and become more comfortable with deeper, complex ideas and applications in computer science. 

This week, the Good Vibes team deployed the recent update of Good Vibes and now have moved on to fixing and improving the Hendrix Assessment website that Hendrix College uses. There are a few issues with the views when the user is on a mobile device, and there are also issues with how the assessments are sorted. The website utilizes ASP.NET, the Microsoft framework for web applications. I have never used it before so I will not only have to learn the codebase, but I will also have to learn the workings of ASP.NET as well as C#, the language that is used in ASP.NET. I did it with Good Vibes and the Flutter toolkit that it uses and I can do it again. It will be a bigger monster to tackle since it is a larger and more developed codebase compared to Good Vibes and it uses a remote Azure SQL database. But just like in video games, each boss gets harder but that's what makes the game more fun: a challenge.

I am excited to continue learning and implementing new things and improving my skills. I hope to make cool new things and be a good teammate to my teammates. Until then, I will continue to do my best in everything I do.
