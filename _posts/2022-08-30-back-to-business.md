It has been a fun and productive summer in the year of 2022. I interned at Northrop Grumman and worked on a couple of projects and furthered my programming and teamwork skills that I am ready to bring to Disco Tray Studios. We have a few new team members that I am excited to work with and get things done this year for some of our partners.

Previously, I had worked mostly on Good Vibes and a little bit on Hendrix Assessment. This time, I am focusing more on Contact Tracing, a mobile and web application aimed at keeping track of people in classrooms who have been in close contact with those who have been sick in order to make it easier to identify those who are at-risk and such. I am also going to be working on Arkansas Asset Builders, a nonprofit organization whose goals are to help people who may be less financially literate file their tax forms. The original process was carried out through Excel so our goal is to create a program that will make the process easier to keep track of certain information and smoothen the process of filing these forms.

It will be a busy semester but I am ready for the challenge!
