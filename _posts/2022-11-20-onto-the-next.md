We were able to demo a somewhat working version of the Arkansas Asset Builders in front of the Disco Tray group. There isn't much functionality since it only lets you upload the files and shows the database records that go in accordance with the filters that you set. The only issue is that the data is so unstandardized that there is really no way to get consistent sets of data where everything is filled out for all users or subsets of users. That is why we will be meeting with Joyia Yorgey who is a part of Arkansas Asset Builders. Hopefully, she will help clarify what works and what needs to be worked on with our demo. It would also help to figure out what we can do about the data that she sends us.

Now that we have taken a slight hiatus from Arkansas Asset Builders, it is time to continue working on issues for Hendrix Assessment. My current task is to figure out how to get admin to view all active classes. It will be somewhat difficult since I have mainly worked on the front-end side of Hendrix Assessment so this will require me to know some of the backend of Hendrix Assessment, which is quite large and convoluted. But I will keep calm and carry on.
