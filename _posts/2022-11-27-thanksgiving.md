Happy Thanksgiving to anyone who is reading this, even if it isn't Thanksgiving. I hope you were able to eat a lot of good food and spend a lot of time with friends and family. I had a good time while being down in San Diego with my family, so there was minimal work done this week. However, we were able to meet with the Arkansas Asset Builder head and get more feedback on what we had so far and more clarification on different parts of the data as well as what she wanted from the project and what we had.

With the new feedback, we are able to do more work on the Arkansas Asset Builders project and make more progress on the application. Hopefully we will be able to finish a working version that is able to be given to the head before tax season in February. This will most likely track into winter break but it will be a fun project to work on while being off of school.
