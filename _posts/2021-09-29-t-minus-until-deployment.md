The past week has been a big learning experience for me, quite literally.
I spent the bulk of the time between last week's meeting and this week's
meeting trying to understand the different parts of Flutter. As it stands,
Stateless and Stateful Widgets still somewhat elude me while understanding
builds and contexts in apps, especially in a somewhat developed app such as
Good Vibes, is incredibly confusing. Thankfully, I have an Andrew Eveld to
help me understand the Good Vibes codebase and the workings of Flutter. It
works out quite well that I am attempting to learn Flutter by creating a Flutter
project of my own as I have a senior Capstone project where I am trying to
create an ultimate student organizer app which will use Flutter. Overall,
compared to when I first started working on improving Good Vibes and taking
on something that was quite intimidating, I am slowly but surely getting a
handle on things and becoming acquainted with how the app works.

I was trusted to learn and implement Firebase Analytics into the Good Vibes app
so that the Disco Tray Studios organization could better understand how users
will use the app when the app gets released to selected users for testing.
After a lot of Googling and searching on YouTube for the best method for
implementing analytics, I managed to create a simple way to implement Firebase
Analytics into the app (I was honestly proud of myself, it was quite
confusing to understand at first, especially how things were tracked as well as
what needed to be tracked or manually implemented). Now, we are able to view
what pages users tend to use, what moods users generally are, and other statistics
for us to gauge as the app progresses.

Speaking of releasing for testing, Good Vibes has finally been built for testing!
Soon, select users will be able to test the app and give us feedback on what works
well, what needs improvement, and other sorts of feedback we can use to create
something awesome. It will be really cool and exciting to learn about the process
of releasing an app and getting actual users who aren't affiliated with myself
or Disco Tray Studios, as well as using analytics that the public are using. As
I sit in my room after finally implementing Firebase Analytics and working all
day on the app, I can't wait to see what the next several days will hold, good
or bad.
