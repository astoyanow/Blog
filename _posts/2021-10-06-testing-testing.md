Good Vibes has been distributed to testers! People outside of Disco Tray
Studios are now using the Good Vibes app, which I have been very excited for.
With the Firebase Analytics now implemented into the app, we can now see
the data that users are creating and utilizing as they traverse the app. It is
quite early to do anything with the data and we still do not have many users
but once we get more people on board there will be a lot of cool stuff to look
at. Don't worry, we can't see any user-specific data and everything is anonymous.

Now that I have gotten that big responsibility out of the way, now it is time
to improve the data analytics portion as well as work on smaller objectives
to improve Good Vibes. I was able to format the link in the credits as a
hyperlink in Flutter so that users can actually visit the repository credited
with the user avatar generation. I also made a tiny change so that fonts will
not be grabbed from Google Fonts, but from our own font files so that load
times for the fonts will be instant and the app will look a lot better.

While keeping ideas in mind for updating the rules in the Firebase Database
as well as ideas for analytics (which I will have to implement some form of
anonymous user tracking now), I am now tasked with getting ad support for
Good Vibes. As we will increase our user base, we will start to load the
database with reads and writes, which will cost money once we get past a certain
threshold. Ads will help raise a small amount of money to account for some
spending, so it will be an important part of the app. I am excited to take
part in another endeavor to improve this project.
