The first two weeks working in Disco Tray Studios has already been a big learning experience. I was thrown into the works right away and had to refresh myself in Android
Studio as well as learn about Flutter, HTML, CSS, and other aspects of coding. I was
able to meet with community partners in order to inform and educate them about the
process of working with the Web Systems and Databases class in order to create
a website for the community partners. There were many good ideas that all seemed more than
capable of becoming viable websites that Disco Tray Studios would be able to maintain.

There have been hardware issues that have been getting worse as time progresses.
I currently have a MacBook Pro that was manufactured in 2012, which means that
I can no longer get the most recent OS update which currently is Big Sur. This also
means that I cannot use some software, specifically XCode, which I need in order
to run the Good Vibes app (the app I am currently helping to work on) on iOS.
My computer is also extremely slow and struggles to connect to WiFi at times.
Hopefully this issue gets fixed with the new computer my parents ordered for
me. Fingers crossed.

I plan to implement more things into Good Vibes and get an Android emulator working
(I am even struggling with that) in the coming week. I look forward to learning more
about Flutter and creating apps.
