In lab 4, we learned about how to change Jekyll styling for posts and blogs and how Jekyll files can be replaced to use new formats. I struggled with understanding how it all works and where everything is and how I can change things on the screen from these files. I pretty much do not understand any of it still. Changing certain aspects on the screen and the connections between the different screens still confuses me with the BootStrap Templates. I'm looking forward to just getting this done so I don't have to struggle with it anymore.
