# Introduction Post

Setting up this blog on GitHub pages was a new experience for me because of two things:

- I had to use the terminal to input information in order to install Ruby as well as create files in my repository.
- I was introduced to Jekyll and creating blogs that are going to be converted into HTML.

It was hard trying to figure out how to install Ruby because there was an older version on my computer and I thought I had to install it again but I just had to update it. I am still struggling to understand if I am even creating a viable post right now. I am also still confused with how Jekyll works and how everything is converted to HTML and how elements are related to each other. I am hoping to create something a lot better than my last project of HTML and I am hoping to gain a better understanding of how to make sites visually appealing using HTML.
